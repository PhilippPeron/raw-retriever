# RAW Retriever

RAW Retriever finds RAW images in a folder and copies them to the JPG location. It is made for photographers.

My personal photography workflow consists of downloading the JPGs and sorting them.
Afterwards I get the RAW images for my best images from the camera. That way I don't have to copy all the RAWs from the beginning.
This is better for my SSD and also faster when sorting images.

Usage:
- Run 'RAW Retriever.exe'
- A directory selection dialog pops up where you can select the directory with the RAW images
- Afterwards you just drag JPGs in the small window.
RAW Retriever tries to find the RAW-counterparts in the selected directory or a first level subdirectory and copies them to the JPG directory.
